# Prepared Data Directory

This directory contains processed data files organized into the following subdirectories:

## Structure

- `csv/`: Cleaned and preprocessed CSV files
  - `Treadmill/`: Processed treadmill running data
  - `Overground/`: Processed overground running data
- `tfrecords/`: TensorFlow record files for model training
  - Contains windowed data with spectrograms
- `parquet/`: Parquet format data (if used)

## Data Processing

The data in this directory is automatically generated by:
1. `script_running_data_preparation.py` (creates CSV files)
2. `create_TFRecords_spectrogram2.py` (creates TFRecord files)

Do not modify these files manually. If you need to change the processed data, modify the source files in the Raw directory and rerun the processing scripts.
